Objective:
-three view modes:
 1)overhead orthogonal
 2)overhead perspective
-3D objects
-moving light:
 a)moves automatically
 b)can be stopped and moved under user control
-textures:
 1)stone
 2)metal
 3)concrete
 4)brick
 5)wood

Description: 
3D Scene of cylinders with roofs and a house
that incorporates both lighting and textures
that can be viewed in three dimensions under
user control.
Added different view modes.
Added a moving light source.
Added textures.

Key Bindings:
 a		toggle axes
 0		reset view angle
 m		toggle orthogonal/perspective
 arrows		change view angle
 [		decrease field of view in perspective
 ]		increase field of view in perspective
 PgUp	 	zooms in
 PgDn		zooms out
 l 		toggles lighting
 k		toggles light movement
 <		manually move the light counter-clockwise
 >		manually move the light clockwise
 (		lower the light elevation
 )		raise the light elevation
 ESC		exit
